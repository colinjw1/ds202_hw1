## Final Remarks

I ran into trouble accepting the invitation to become a collaborator. The best way to do this seems to be through the email GitHub sends, but I tried to accept the invitation through my phone which wasn't signed in to my GitHub account so it didn't work. This problem was resolved when I did everything from my computer.
